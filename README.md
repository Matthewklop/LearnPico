## Setup Instructions

Before you begin your projects, ensure your Raspberry Pi Pico and development environment are properly set up.

### 1. Setting Up Your Raspberry Pi Pico

- **Installing MicroPython:**
  - Follow the official [MicroPython setup guide](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/micropython.html) to install MicroPython on your Raspberry Pi Pico.
  - Detailed steps can be found in the [Raspberry Pi Pico Python SDK](raspberry-pi-pico-python-sdk.pdf)&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}, which provides a comprehensive overview of setting up MicroPython, flashing the firmware, and running your first script.

### 2. Installing Thonny IDE

Thonny is a beginner-friendly IDE recommended for programming with the Raspberry Pi Pico. Here's how to set it up:

- **Download and Installation:**
  - Visit the [Thonny website](https://thonny.org) and download the latest version for your operating system.
  - Refer to the setup instructions detailed in your course's [Lab 1 document](cs65_lab1.pdf)&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}, which provides step-by-step guidance on installing and configuring Thonny.

- **Writing Your First Program:**
  - Once Thonny is installed, you can start by writing a simple "Hello, World!" program. Create a new file, write your code, and execute it using the "Run" button.
  - Refer to the [MicroPython documentation](micropython-docs.pdf)&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} for additional examples and coding tips.

### 3. Using Visual Studio Code for Pico Projects

For users who prefer a more feature-rich environment:

- **VS Code Setup:**
  - Install the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) and configure it for MicroPython development.
  - Check out the [Raspberry Pi Pico Python SDK](raspberry-pi-pico-python-sdk.pdf)&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} for instructions on setting up VS Code for Pico projects.

### 4. Flashing the Pico with Firmware

- **Boot Mode and Flashing:**
  - Hold the BOOTSEL button while connecting your Pico to your computer to enter USB mass storage mode.
  - Copy the MicroPython UF2 file to the Pico's storage to flash the firmware.
  - Detailed instructions can be found in the [MicroPython setup guide](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/micropython.html) and [Pico SDK documentation](raspberry-pi-pico-python-sdk.pdf)&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.
